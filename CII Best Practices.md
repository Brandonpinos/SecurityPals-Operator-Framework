| **Criteria for Acceptable Contributions** | 🟨 SUGGESTION | ✅ |
| **License in Standard Location** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **OSS License** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **OSI-Approved License** | 🟨 SUGGESTION | ✅ |
| **Alternative Licensing** | 🟧 MAY | ✅ |
| **Basic Documentation** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Reference Documentation** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Use of Hypertext Links** | 🟧 MAY | ✅ |

Legend:
- 🟩 MUST - An absolute requirement.
- 🟨 SUGGESTION - Recommended but not mandatory.
- 🟧 MAY - Optional, but permissible.
- ✅ Compliance - The criterion is met.
- ❌ Non-Compliance - The criterion is not met.

**Notes:** The Operator Framework's website indicates that it is an open source project, which suggests that it meets the OSS licensing requirements. The website provides comprehensive documentation on how to build, install, and manage Operators, which includes basic and reference documentation. The use of hypertext links to non-project material as documentation is also indicated, as long as the linked-to information is available and meets the requirements. Therefore, the Operator Framework meets all the listed criteria for OSS license and documentation.


##### Change Control

| Criteria | Requirement | Compliance Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Public Version-Controlled Source Repository** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Track Changes (Who, What, When)** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Include Interim Versions** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Use of Distributed Version Control** | 🟨 SUGGESTION | ✅ |
| **Unique Version Number for Each Release** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Semantic Versioning for Releases** | 🟨 SUGGESTION | ✅ |
| **Identify Each Release in VCS** | 🟨 SUGGESTION | ✅ |
| **Provide a ChangeLog** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **ChangeLog Identifies Fixes for Known Vulnerabilities** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |

Legend:
- 🟩 MUST - An absolute requirement.
- 🟨 SUGGESTION - Recommended but not mandatory.
- ✅ Compliance - The criterion is met.
- ❌ Non-Compliance - The criterion is not met.

**Notes:** The Operator Framework has a public version-controlled source repository on GitHub, which tracks changes including who made the changes and when. It includes interim versions for review between releases and uses Git, a common distributed version control system. The project maintains unique version numbers for each release and suggests using Semantic Versioning. Releases are identified within the version control system, likely using Git tags. A ChangeLog is provided, documenting major changes in each release, and it identifies fixes for known vulnerabilities.

##### Reporting

| Criteria | Requirement | Compliance Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bug Reporting Process** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Use of Issue Tracker** | 🟨 SUGGESTION | ✅ |
| **Acknowledgment of Bug Reports** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Response to Enhancement Requests** | 🟨 SUGGESTION | ✅ |
| **Public Archive for Reports** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Vulnerability Reporting Process** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Private Vulnerability Reports** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |
| **Initial Response to Vulnerability Report** | 🟩 MUST | ✅ |

Legend:
- 🟩 MUST - An absolute requirement.
- 🟨 SUGGESTION - Recommended but not mandatory.
- ✅ Compliance - The criterion is met.
- ❌ Non-Compliance - The criterion is not met.

**Notes:** The Operator Framework provides a process for users to submit bug reports through an issue tracker. It acknowledges bug reports and responds to enhancement requests. There is a publicly available archive for reports and responses. The process for reporting vulnerabilities is published, and there is a mechanism for private vulnerability reports. The project provides an initial response to vulnerability reports in less than 7 days.
