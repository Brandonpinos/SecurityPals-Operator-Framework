Security Self Assessment

Overview:
Operator Framework is an open-source toolkit that provides the runtime environment and software development kit (SDK) for building and running Kubernetes applications, dubbed “Operators”, in an effective and easily scalable way.

The SDK is a framework that allows developers to build and manipulate Operators without prior knowledge of the complexities of Kubernetes API. By providing libraries and tools, developers can use familiar languages to streamline the process.

Background:
Streamlining processes for consumers, workers, and industries in general is often of utmost importance. It saves time, money, and headaches for everyone involved. When it comes to installing a piece of software, most expect it to be simple with only a few clicks involved, the same applies to updates and upgrades for that software. However every machine is different and each application has numerous dependencies that are necessary to run it correctly.To expect consumers or people who are not as proficient with technology to install the correct one from slightly different variations would be nonsensical.

Containerization solves this problem. Containerization is the process of packaging an application with all its dependencies into a single, self-contained unit called a container. This would include the application code, source tools, runtime libraries, and more. By providing an isolated environment, this ensures that the application would be consistent in running on multiple different machines, regardless of the individual conditions.Containerization allows for ease of use, portability, scalability, and efficient deployment of applications.

A developer team seeking to utilize these benefits for their application would find Kubernetes very helpful. Kubernetes is an open source containerization platform that automates application deployment, updates, and overall management. It provides the container infrastructure and allows developers to define their application requirements. These reasons alone with a host of other benefits would be a great help to any development team.

However, setting up and configuring Kubernetes clusters can pose a challenge for developers unfamiliar with Kubernetes. It requires an in-depth understanding of networking, infrastructure, and storage concepts. These are significant learning curves that create a “threshold filter” of sorts that leads developers to deciding on a different alternative to Kubernetes. 

Operator Framework is a solution to this problem along with providing several benefits that Kubernetes does not natively supply. Operator Framework allows developers to build Operators with languages and libraries that they are already familiar with. Operators built with Operator Framework allows even more options for automation of tasks and workflows beyond the basic functionalities provided by Kubernetes. Overall Operator Framework complements the benefits that Kubernetes offers by providing the specialized tools for easier learning for developers, better automation, and better scalability making Kubernetes an easier more powerful tool.

Actors:
Operator Framework is comprised of a few different parts including, 

Operator Framework SDK : The framework used to build and package Operators. Using Operator SDK allows developers to easily automate and manage any Operators they create.
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) : Provides the runtime environment and APIs for managing the lifecycle of Operators and their resources. It also helps in deploying, installing, and updating Operators
Operator Hub : A community-driven public hub for sharing and discovering Operators for various uses.

These components make up Operator Framework and make it very useful for developing, deploying and managing Operators.



Actions:
Same thing as Actors?





Goals:
The goals of Operator Framework are mainly to simplify and enhance applications  on Kubernetes clusters. 

It does this by using the Operator SDK to simplify creation and automation of Operators. This thoroughly increases developer productivity.

Operator Framework also enhances the reliability of complex applications by allowing them to declare specific configurations to make sure the application is always running as desired. This would in turn reduce possible downtime and making it easier for the responsible department

For security guarantees, Operator Framework uses the same principles as Kubernetes such as Role-Based Access Control so that applications cannot act outside of the scope provided. This along with other network isolation policies ensures the security aspect. 

NonGoals:
Although Operator Framework enhances many basic features of Kubernetes, as a result it also shares some of the same non-goals. The logging and monitoring, although provided, are basic as they are not meant to be a replacement for fully comprehensive security logging and monitoring alternatives.

They also do not cover every aspect of deployment of applications. They mainly focus on the lifecycle of the Operator itself. This includes the deployment, upgrading, and scaling of Operators while leaving out other aspects of deployment like storage and networking.
