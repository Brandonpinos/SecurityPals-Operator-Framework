Sure, I'd be happy to explain in more depth.

When you create a Kubernetes operator, you're essentially creating an automated process that interacts with the Kubernetes API on your behalf. This operator needs certain permissions to interact with the resources it manages. These permissions are defined in the operator's **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** rules¹².

There are two types of classification for Operators:
1. **Namespace-scoped**: The operator watches and manages resources within a namespace and requires permissions within these namespaces to do so¹.
2. **Cluster-scoped**: The operator watches and manages resources across or all namespaces within a cluster and requires cluster-scoped permissions to achieve this¹.

Improper permission scoping can lead to security issues. For example, if an operator has more permissions than it needs (over-privileged), it could potentially be exploited to perform unauthorized actions. On the other hand, if an operator doesn't have enough permissions (under-privileged), it might not be able to perform its intended functions¹.

Here are some best practices for operator permission scoping¹²:
- **Minimize cluster-scope and namespace-scope permissions**: Only grant the permissions that are absolutely necessary for the operator to function¹.
- **Reduce the usage of cluster-scope permissions**: The use of cluster-scoped Operators should be justified¹.
- **RBAC permissions**: Define user or group permissions to cluster resources with Kubernetes RBAC².
- **Descoped Operator**: Reduce the scope of the Operator's permissions as much as possible¹.
- **Pod and container securityContext and Security Context Constraints (SCCs)**: Set appropriate security contexts for your pods and containers¹.
- **Continuous security scans**: Regularly scan your operator and its dependencies for vulnerabilities¹.
- **Deployment location**: Be mindful of where you deploy your operator. Some environments may have stricter security requirements than others¹.

Remember, security is a continuous process and it's important to regularly review and update your operator's permissions as needed. It's also a good idea to stay updated with the latest security practices in the Kubernetes community¹².
